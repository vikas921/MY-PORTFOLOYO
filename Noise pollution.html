                <p>We know that a sound is a form of energy. Sometimes the sound can be soothing to listen to and, at times, loud to hear.<br> Sound can travel in the air and is produced by the vibration of objects. Regular exposure to a higher sound<br>                    level that impacts humans and other living organisms is known as sound pollution. <br>This article will help us understand what noise pollution is, the types of noise and pollution, and its causes and examples.</p>

            </center>
            <center>
                <p>
                    The word noise is derived from the Latin word ‘Nausea’, which means sickness in which one feels the need to vomit.<br> Noise is the unpleasant and undesirable sound which leads to discomfort in human beings.<br>
                    <font color="yellow">
                        The intensity of sound is measured in decibels (dB).</font> The faintest sound that the human ear can hear is 1 Db.<br> Due to increasing noise around the civilizations, noise pollution has become a matter of concern. <br>Some
                    of its major causes are vehicles, aircraft, industrial machines, loudspeakers, crackers, etc. When used at high volume, <br>some other appliances also contribute to noise pollution, like television, transistor, radio, etc.

                following are the three types of pollution:
            </center>
            <font color="pink" size="4">1. Transport Noise :-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black">Transport Noise </font>It mainly consists of traffic noise which has increased in recent years with the increase in the number of vehicles. The increase in noise pollution leads to deafening of older people,
                <font color="black">Transport Noise </font> headache, hypertension, etc.</p>
            <font color="pink" size="4">2. Neighbourhood Noise :-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black">Neighbourhood Noise </font>The noise from gadgets, household utensils etc. Some of the main sources are musical instruments, transistors, loudspeakers, etc.</p>
            <font color="pink" size="4">3. Industrial Noise :-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black">Industrial Noise </font>It is the high-intensity sound which is caused by heavy industrial machines. According to many researches, industrial noise pollution damages the hearing ability to around 20%.</p>

                Following are the causes and sources of noise pollution:
            </center>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <font color="pink" size="3">Industrialisation: </font> Industrialisation has led to an increase in noise pollution as the use of heavy machinery such as generators, mills, huge exhaust fans are used, resulting in the production of
                    <font color="black" size="3">Industrialisation:</font> unwanted noise

                <li>
                    <font color="pink" size="3">Vehicles: </font>Increased number of vehicles on the roads are the second reason for noise pollution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <font color="pink" size="3">Events: </font>Weddings, public gatherings involve loudspeakers to play music resulting in the production of unwanted noise in the neighbourhood.
                </li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <font color="pink" size="3">Construction sites: </font>Mining, construction of buildings, etc add to the noise pollution
                </li>

                Noise Pollution can be hazardous to human health in the following ways:
            </center>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <font color="pink" size="3">Hypertension: </font>It is a direct result of noise pollution which is caused due to elevated blood levels for a longer duration.

                <li>
                    <font color="pink" size="3">Hearing loss: </font>Constant exposure of human ears to loud noise that are beyond the range of sound that human ears can withstand damages the eardrums, resulting in loss of hearing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <font color="pink" size="3">Sleeping disorder: </font>Lack of sleep might result in fatigue and low energy level throughout the day affecting everyday activities. Noise pollution hampers the sleep cycles leading to irritation and

                    Some noise pollution preventive measuares are provided in the points below:
                </center>
                <ul>
                    <li>Honking in public places like teaching institutes, hospitals, etc. should be banned.</li>
                    <li>In commercial, hospital, and industrial buildings, adequate soundproof systems should be installed.</li>
                    <li>Musical instruments’ sound should be controlled to desirable limits.</li>
                    <li>Dense tree cover is useful in noise pollution prevention.</li>
                    <li>Explosives should not be used in forest, mountainous and mining areas.</li>
