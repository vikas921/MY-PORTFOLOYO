            <center>Air pollution refers to any physical, chemical or biological change in the air. <br> It is the contamination of air by harmful gases, dust and smoke which affects plants, animals and humans drastically.<br>There is a certain percentage of
                gases present in the atmosphere. An increase or decrease in the composition of these gases is harmful to survival. <br>This imbalance in the gaseous composition has resulted in an increase in earth’s temperature, which is known as global
                warming.

                <font color="brown" size="3">2. Secondary Pollutants:- </font>The pollutants formed by the intermingling and reaction of primary pollutants are known as secondary pollutants. Smog, formed by the intermingling of smoke<br> and fog, is a secondary pollutant.

            <font color="gray" size="4">1. Burning of Fossil Fuels:-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black">Burning of Fossil Fuels</font>The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur dioxide. Carbon monoxide released by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels also results in air pollution.</p>
            <font color="gray" size="4">2. Automobiles:-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black">1. Automobiles</font>The gases emitted from vehicles such as jeeps, trucks, cars, buses, etc. pollute the environment. These are the major sources of greenhouse gases and also result in diseases among individuals.</p>
            <font color="gray" size="4">3. Agricultural activities:-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black">3. Agricultural activities</font>Ammonia is one of the most hazardous gases emitted during agricultural activities. The insecticides, pesticides and fertilisers emit harmful chemicals in the atmosphere<br>
                <font color="black">3. Agricultural activities</font> and contaminate it.</p>
            <font color="gray" size="4">4. Factories and Industries:-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black">4. Factories and Industries:-</font>Factories and industries are the main source of carbon monoxide, organic compounds, hydrocarbons and chemicals. These are released into the air, degrading its quality.</p>
            <font color="gray" size="4">5. Domestic Sources:-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black">5. Domestic Sources:-</font>The household cleaning products and paints contain toxic chemicals that are released in the air. The smell from the newly painted walls is the smell of the chemicals present in the

                <p>The hazarduous effects of air pollution on the environment include:</p>
            </center>
            <font color="gray" size="4">1. Diseases:-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black" size="4">1. Diseases</font> Air pollution has resulted in several respiratory disorders and heart diseases among humans. The cases of lung cancer have increased in the last few decades. Children living near polluted
                <font color="black" size="4">1. Diseases</font> areas are more prone to pneumonia and asthma. Many people die every year due to the direct or indirect effects of air pollution.</p>
            <font color="gray" size="4">2. Global Warming:-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black" size="4">2. Global Warming</font>Due to the emission of greenhouse gases, there is an imbalance in the gaseous composition of the air. This has led to an increase in the temperature of the earth. This increase in
                <font color="black" size="4">2. Global Warming</font> earth’s temperature is known as <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming"> global warming</a>. This has resulted in the melting of glaciers and an increase in sea levels. Many areas are submerged
                underwater.

            <font color="gray" size="4">3. Acid Rain:-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black" size="4">3. Acid Rain</font>The burning of fossil fuels releases harmful gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides in the air. The water droplets combine with these pollutants, become acidic and fall as acid rain
                <font color="black" size="4">3. Acid Rain</font> which damages human, animal and plant life.</p>
            <font color="gray" size="4">4. Ozone Layer Depletion:-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black" size="4">4. Ozone layer Depletion</font>The release of chlorofluorocarbons, halons, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere is the major cause of depletion of the ozone layer. The depleting ozone layer
                <font color="black" size="4">4. Ozone layer Depletion</font> does not prevent the harmful ultraviolet rays coming from the sun and causes skin diseases and eye problems among individuals.</p>
            <font color="gray" size="4">5. Effects on Animals:-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black" size="4">5. Effects on Animals</font>The air pollutants suspend in the water bodies and affect aquatic life. Pollution also compels the animals to leave their habitat and shift to a new place. This renders them stray

                <p>Following are the measures one should adopt,to control air pollution:</p>
            </center>
            <font color="gray" size="4">1. Avoid Using Vehicles:-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black" size="4">1. Avoid Using Vehicles</font>People should avoid using vehicles for shorter distances. Rather, they should prefer public modes of transport to travel from one place to another. This not only prevents
                <font color="black" size="4">1. Avoid Using Vehicles</font> but also conserves energy.</p>
            <font color="gray" size="4">2. Energy Conservation:-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black" size="4">2. Energy Conservation</font>A large number of fossil fuels are burnt to generate electricity. Therefore, do not forget to switch off the electrical appliances when not in use. Thus, you can save the
                <font color="black" size="4">2. Energy Conservation</font> environment at the individual level. Use of energy-efficient devices such as CFLs also controls pollution to a greater level.</p>
            <font color="gray" size="4">3. Use of Clean Energy Resources:-</font>
            <p>
                <font color="black" size="4">3. Use of Clean Energy Resources</font>The use of solar, wind and geothermal energies reduce air pollution at a larger level. Various countries, including India, have implemented the use of these
