            <p>Land pollution — or the degradation of our soil by outside contaminants — is largely the result of unsustainable agricultural practices, the improper disposal of waste (both hazardous and <br> non-hazardous), mining (often called “mineral
                extraction”), illegal dumping and littering.</center>
        </p>
        <center>
            <p>In the 21st century, there isn’t a single surface or space on Earth that hasn’t in some way been impacted by pollution. The consequences are far-reaching for both the environment and human health.<br> While the prevention of land pollution
                on a large scale will require changes in policy and regulation, there are steps that individuals can take in their daily lives to help prevent land pollution.</p>

        </center>
        <center>
            <p>Land pollution refers to the deterioration of the earth’s land surfaces at and below ground level. It is caused by the accumulation of solid and liquid waste materials that contaminate groundwater and soil. These waste materials are often
                referred to as municipal solid waste (MSW), which includes both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. As different waste materials and pollutants like heavy metals, pesticides, plastic, litter and pharmaceuticals sit on top of and leach into
                our soil, they change and degrade its natural composition. Over time, some pollutants can also go through a chemical transformation, creating secondary pollutants like fumaric and phthalic acids. The permeability of the soil formations
                below the waste can increase or reduce the risk of land pollution. The higher the permeability of the soil, the more likely that land pollution will occur. Meanwhile, extreme weather events like hurricanes and floods can exacerbate the
                effects of land pollution as they disperse or concentrate certain pollutants.</p>

            While there are many causes of land pollution, the main contributors include litter, waste, urbanization, construction, mining, extraction and agriculture. <br>Let’s dive into how these different issues lead to increased land pollution.

        </center>
        <center>
            <p>
                Littering is the improper disposal of waste products. While it can happen by mistake (as in an unsecured object flying out of the bed of a truck),<br> littering continues to be largely a deliberate act. Whether it happens intentionally
                or unintentionally, littering has environmental consequences.

            <p>
                Litter can take a variety of forms, but some items are littered more frequently than others. In a study by
                <a href="C:\Users\ACER\Downloads\Summary.pdf" Keep America Beautiful> Keep America Beautiful  </a>(KAB), researchers found that frequently littered items include:
        </center>
        <ul>
            <li> Cigarette butts</li>
            <li> Fast food packaging (bags, cups, serving items)</li>
            <li> Food packaging (wrappers, boxes, film, styrofoam/expanded polystyrene)</li>
            <li>
                <li> Alcoholic beverage containers (beer & single-serve wine)</li>
                <li>Tire and vehicle debris</li>
                <li> Plastic bags</li>
                <li> Plastic bottles
                </li>
                <li> Construction waste</li>
        </ul>
        <center> Unfortunately, these are just a few examples of littering. Cigarettes are the most frequently littered item, with an estimated 9.7 billion cigarette butts discarded along roadways and waterways. The KAB study also found that, since the COVID-19
            pandemic, there has been an increased incidence of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), with an estimated 207 million PPE gloves and masks littering roadways and waterways. All states have littering laws (with varying degrees of penalties
            and fees) that make littering illegal, but the top illegally dumped items include household garbage, hazardous waste, appliances, mattresses, furniture and e-waste (unwanted electronics).

                Even if you don’t litter, have you ever stopped to ask yourself exactly why is littering bad? Other than just being unsightly, litter has serious consequences for the environment and your community.<br> Keep these in mind the next time
                you see plastic bottles on the ground.s

            <font color="yellow" size="4">1. Litter is one of the causes of pollution </font>
        </center>
        <center>As litter degrades, chemicals and microparticles are released. These chemicals aren’t natural to the environment and can, therefore, cause a number of problems. For example, cigarette butts can contain chemicals such as arsenic and formaldehyde.
            These poisons can make their way into the soil and freshwater sources, negatively impacting humans and animals. In fact, 60% of water pollution is attributed to litter. In addition to water and land pollution, litter can also pollute the air.
            Researchers estimate that more than 40% of the world’s litter is burned in the open air, which can release toxic emissions. These emissions can cause respiratory issues, other health problems and even be a starting base for acid rain.

            <center>
                Animals are innocent victims affected by litter every day. Researchers estimate that over one million animals die each year after ingesting, or becoming entrapped in, improperly disposed trash. Plastic litter is the most common killer of animals and marine
                animals are the most notably affected. Each year over 100,000 dolphins, fish, whales, turtles and more drown after becoming entangled in or digesting plastic litter etc .
